These files are edited by me to improve colors in CGA mode of GBS-CGA/EGA.
Better light colors are shown. Dark Gray will also be displayed more appropriately.

You can also see MDA colors when the CGA/EGA switch is set to CGA input.

1. cgaega_white: MDA color is white.
2. cgaega_red:   MDA color is red.
3. cgaega_green: MDA color is green.
